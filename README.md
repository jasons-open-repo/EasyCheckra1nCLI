Q&A
Q: Doe's EasyCheckra1nCLI contain BILLIONS of bugs?
A: No, not billions only some. We, the EasyCheckra1nCLI Team reduces bugs by staying as native as possible to the 
official checkra1n. But, we HAVE to edit some internal files to make it work without the additional files. 

Q: Why is EasyCheckra1nCLI even needed?
A: Well, 1. It goesn't have additional icon files and GUI based apps so, less space. 2. Anti-Virus will less make
false positive since it's located at home folder which is VERY delicate.

Q: Is EasyCheckra1nCLI a rip-off?
A: No. It's directly ported directly from official checkra1n files.
